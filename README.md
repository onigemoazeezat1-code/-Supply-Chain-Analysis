Optimizing Supply Chain Process for Improved Efficiency – Onyx Data  Project Overview

This project provides a detailed analysis of Onyx Data’s supply chain dataset, offering transparency into operations from production to distribution. The aim was to uncover actionable insights that help stakeholders improve supply chain efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance decision-making.

The analysis was conducted using Structured Query Language (SQL) for data exploration and performance tracking, complemented by Power BI for dashboard visualization.

Data Source

The dataset was sourced from Onyx Data’s official LinkedIn page. It contains 26 columns and 100 rows, covering multiple facets of the supply chain, such as product details, suppliers, logistics, and customer demographics.

Tools Used

SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL): For data cleaning, querying, and analysis.

Power BI: For building interactive dashboards and visual summaries.

Power Query: For preprocessing, data formatting, and integration with Power BI.

Data Preparation & SQL Analysis

I created and structured the supply chain database using SQL, beginning with a custom table schema that included key metrics such as product type, supplier name, transportation mode, manufacturing cost, and defect rate.

I then ran a series of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) queries to answer critical business questions such as:

Which products and SKUs drive the highest revenue?

Which supplier delivers the most consistent performance?

What are the most cost-effective transportation modes and routes?

How do manufacturing and shipping costs impact profitability?

Each query was designed to extract operational insights and performance indicators across the supply chain lifecycle.

Power BI Visualization

After executing and validating the SQL queries, I connected the processed data to Power BI to create two interactive dashboards:

Overview Dashboard: Displays product performance, revenue distribution, customer segments, and geographic insights.

Supplier & Logistics Dashboard: Highlights supplier performance, logistics efficiency, lead time variation, and shipping cost trends.

Key Findings

Total Revenue: $577.60K

Product Category: Skincare products generated 40% ($241.63K) of total revenue, outperforming Haircare (30%) and Cosmetics (28%). However, skincare also showed the highest defect rate, signaling quality control issues.

Geographic Insights: Mumbai contributed the highest revenue with over ₦138K.

Customer Demographics: Female customers drove the majority of total sales.

Manufacturing Cost: Skincare products incurred the highest production cost (41% higher) than others.

Top Performing SKUs: SKUs 51, 38, 31, 90, and 2 ranked as the top 5 revenue contributors.

Inventory: Total stock stood at 4,777 units, with an average lead time of 16 days — indicating room to improve turnover rates.

Supplier Insights: Supplier 1 generated the highest revenue but exhibited significant lead time variation, which could affect customer satisfaction.

Logistics:

Total shipping cost amounted to $554.81, with Carrier A being the most expensive.

Road transport was the most preferred mode but also had the highest average cost per shipment.

Recommendations

To optimize supply chain performance, the following actions are suggested:

Maintain consistent stock levels for top-performing products to prevent revenue loss.

Target low-performing regions with localized marketing strategies.

Diversify supplier base to reduce dependence on Supplier 1.

Prioritize timely deliveries to enhance customer satisfaction.

Optimize delivery routes and leverage Carrier C for cost efficiency.

Introduce quality improvement and waste reduction programs to lower defect rates.
